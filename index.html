      <h2>History of the Flag</h2>
      <p>
        The national flag is a symbol of nationhood and unity. It was first unfurled at midnight on
        September twenty-first, 1981as Belize became an independent nation. The flag’s design
        was the work of the National Symbols Committee which received submissions from the
        public. But over the years, there have been changes to the red, white and blue
        standard. Aside from the variations in the colours, the most recent departure from the
        original design can be found in the coat of arms, (news 5 sept 20 ,2010).
        In 1819 the colony then known as British Honduras obtained its coat of arms,
        subsequently slightly modified. The design featured a mahogany tree, hinting at the rich
        sylvan resources of the area, as well as a shield and two supporters. In the original
        design the supporters were of African background, but now one is a mestizo, the other a
        “Creole,” as the term is defined in Belize). These men hold tools of the trade—an axe
        and the paddle used to send trees downriver for export. The shield is divided into three
        sections—a paddle and a maul crossed on a white background, a two-handed saw and
        an axe crossed in dark yellow, and a ship sailing over waves in blue. The Latin motto
        “Sub umbra floreo” (“I flourish in the shade”) is a reference to the area’s forests. 
        Believing that in the past the coat of arms had appeared on a white disk in the centre of
        a blue flag, nationalists established that flag for the PUP, which led the nation to
        independence. The arms were framed by a wreath bearing 50 leaves, a reminder of the
        year 1950, when the first opposition to British rule began. After local self-government
        was established in 1964, the flag unofficially flew over public buildings. Finally, on
        Independence Day (September 21, 1981), a revised national flag was officially hoisted.
        Red horizontal stripes were added at top and bottom for the opposition UDP so that the
        national flag would not be simply that of the PUP. In an article of Britannica (Smith W.

      <h2>Design Process</h2>
      <h1>Initial Concept</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>The design process began with national discussions to create a flag that represented Belize's identity and heritage.</li>
        <li>Input was gathered from various stakeholders, including government officials and citizens.</li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Official Adoption</h1>
      <ul>
        <li>The flag was officially adopted by an act of the Belizean government, and it has since been used in various national occasions and events.</li>
        <li>The flag is raised during national holidays, ceremonies, and at government buildings</li>
        <li>It serves as a symbol of unity, pride, and the diverse cultural heritage of Belize.</li>
      </ul>
      <p style="margin-top: 40px;">
        Before Belize became independent, there was a debate about what the new country’s flag should look like. The United Democratic Party (UDP) didn’t suggest a specific design, but they did stress the importance of having a flag that could unite everyone in Belize, regardless of their political beliefs. To make sure the flag would be a true national symbol, the government set up a National Symbols Committee with members from different political backgrounds. This committee held a competition, asking Belizeans to send in their ideas for a national flag.
        The design that was chosen came from two public servants: Everal Waight, who was a Permanent Secretary, and Inez Sánchez, who was the Chief Education Officer. The flag they created has a blue background with two red stripes—one at the top and one at the bottom. These stripes are each one-fifth the width of the flag. In the center, there’s a white circle that contains Belize’s Coat of Arms.
        The blue color on the flag was originally associated with the People’s United Party (PUP), while the red stripes were added to include the UDP’s colors. This combination was meant to symbolize unity between the country’s main political parties and, by extension, all Belizeans. The Coat of Arms in the middle highlights Belize’s history, especially its mahogany industry, and features two woodcutters, a mahogany tree, and the national motto: "Sub Umbra Floreo," which means "Under the shade I flourish."
        This flag was officially adopted on September 21, 1981, when Belize became independent. It stands as a symbol of national unity and pride, representing all Belizeans no matter their political views. In 2019, the government also made sure the flag’s design was standardized, so it would look the same everywhere in the country.

    <section id="trueStory">
        <h2>True Story of the Belize Flag</h2>
        <p>NOW MY FELLOW BELIZEANS. As promised to you, here is the TRUE STORY of the Flag of Belize. - - I was there when this story began.
        Prior to 1950, when the PUP was founded, there was never in DREAMS the idea that there would be the need for another flag of British Honduras. - - - Many British Hondurans proudly shouted, - " I was born under the British Flag and I will die under it. "
        IN FACT, THERE ARE STILL MANY BELIZEANS WITH THIS IN MIND.
        FAST FORWARD to January 1st, 1950,
        When the British Honduras Dollar was devalued at Midnight, of December 31st, 1949, an urgent meeting was called at George Price residence, where a decision sprouted to break ties with the British Colonial Yoke.
        At a historic public meeting held, at the Battlefield, on January 6th, 1950, young George Price in his powerful address, stated.
        " PATRIOTS we are. Loyal citizens of this country. - We rise to defend our God given rights against Economic slavery, human misery, and bodily starvation.
        We defend these rights at this stage, by a constitutional and legitimate protest. "
        FROM THIS DAY ONWARD, the peaceful Revolution began, and the Movement of Independence began to prepare the way forward.
        The People's Committee began making the preparations for this onward struggle. There was a need for a proposed FLAG, a NAME for the future Nation, an Anthem and other trimmings.
        BAM BAM, an old man in his 90's, by name Mr Bennet, came to Mr Price and told him a story, told to him by his grandfather.
        The Story. - " My grandfather told me that on the FLAGPOLE behind the Supreme Court, there was another FLAG, called the BAYMEN FLAG. - It had a sailboat and working tools on the flag. "
        George Price immediately called Mr Nacho Valdez, an artist and Choreographer and asked him to dig into this Story.
        Nacho found two pieces of evidence. -
        1. - The Colonial Flag of 1862, which had the British Flag on one corner and an ensign with a Sailboat and logging tools on the other corner.)
        2. -Then there was the Coat of Arms, of British Honduras, as granted by Royal Charter, on 28th January 1907.
        WITH THESE INSTRUMENTS in hand, Mr Price then commissioned Mr Nacho Valdez and others ( I think Armando Diaz was among them) to design a proposed FLAG.
        SO, WAS, A PROPOSED FLAG DESIGNED, BY ADDING, 50 green Leaves in a Corolla to signify 1950. This was handed over to Mama Jane Usher to sow on a Pale Blue Cloth. -This proposed FLAG was then passed on to the Angelus Press, owned by Mr Andrew Burns, and POST CARDS were printed. (I have one of the Originals.)
        This proposed flag was presented to the people at many public meetings, all over the country for their approval.
        AND SO, THIS WAS BRANDED AS THE FUTURE FLAG OF BELIZE.
        Foot note. - The UDP, at all their Public Meetings, REJECTED this Flag, as looking too much like the Guatemalan Flag.
